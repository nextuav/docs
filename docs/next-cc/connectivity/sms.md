# SMS

For operations such as long range delivery, a drone can fly through areas where the LTE strength is weak. In such cases,
the NextCC automatically shifts between 5G, 4G, 3G and 2G based on the availability of the network. As an added
redundancy, the NextCC can also be configured to send its location via SMS directly to a phone number if no internet is
available.
