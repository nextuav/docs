# Setup Hardware

![NextCC Integration](./img/setup-hardware-intro.png)

## Antennas

Connect the 2 antennas to the **MAIN** and **DIV** pins of the cellular module.

![Antennas](./img/antennas-removebg-preview.png)

*Note: For simplicity the antennas have been removed in the following sections.*

## SIM Card

The SIM card should be inserted as shown.

## Flight Controller (P1)

- Take a 6 pin JST cable provided with the NextCC and make sure that the for RX, TX and GND pins correspond with the TX,
  RX and GND of the Pixhawk respectively.
- Remove the other wires (especially the 5V wire).
- Set the baud rate of any of Pixhawk's **TELEM** ports to **57600** and make sure that it is configured as a
  **MAVLink 2** output.
- Use the JST cable to connect the **TELEM** port of the Pixhawk to the **P1 (UART2)** port of the NextCC.

*Note: Do not power the Pixhawk or any other component using the 5V provided by the NextCC.*

## Telemetry Receiver (P2)

- Cable : 6 pin
- Connect the P2 port of the NextCC to the air unit using a UART cable.
- *Standard Connection:* Connect the air unit to your autopilot.

Please refer to the pin out diagram below. [*Note- Rx Tx may be swapped*]

## PAYLOAD (optional)

This section explains the integration of NextCC with an IP camera. To illustrate an example the IP camera used is a SIYI MK15 IP67.

### IP camera

- An IP camera, or Internet Protocol camera, can transmit and receive data via a computer network and the internet.
- Connect it to the network hub.
- In case of the SIYI MK15 IP camera, connect the wire of the camera to the P4 port of the Network Hub.
- Connect the air unit to the network hub [to receive the video feed on [launchpad](/launchpad/introduction.md)]
