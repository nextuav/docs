# Introduction

NextCC is an indigenous Companion Computer that is an addition to a usual flight controller. It is equipped with a
powerful processor, high-speed communication interfaces, and advanced sensor integration capabilities. It is designed to
work seamlessly with a wide range of MAVLink based drones, including PX4 and Ardupilot systems, enabling them to receive
commands remotely including entire automated flight paths, perform object detection and tracking, process data in
real-time, and make smart decisions even when the pilot is not available.

With an in-build 4G/5G module, it transforms your drone into a cloud connected drone with endless possibilities such as
reliable BVLoS operations and live video transmission from an infinite distance.

NextCC interfaces with the [NextConsole](/next-console), a cloud-based drone control software.
