# Permissions

## Location Permission

Location permissions are required by the app to show the **user** location. This helps the pilots to get a good idea of
their relative position with respect to the drone.

- `Precise` - This estimate is usually within 50 meters and is sometimes as accurate as within a few meters or better.
- `Approximate` - This estimate is accurate to within about 3 square kilometers.

## Media Permission

By granting this permission you will be able to import **KML** and **KMZ** files into the application. Also, you will be
able to store the compressed versions of the drone camera pictures.

## Bluetooth Permissions

These permissions are required for LaunchPad to connect to a telemetry device using Bluetooth.
