## Mission Item Buttons

Each mission item has three buttons.

- `Play`: Loads the [Mission Planning Screen](./mission-planning-screen.md) with the mission.
- `Delete`: Delete the mission.
- `Info`: Show the mission information.

## Map

If you already have missions created then the world map on the left will zoom into that area. Tapping on a mission will
highlight the corresponding polygon.
