# Mission Planning Screen

As soon as you tap any mission type option or the play button of any mission in the
[Mission List Screen](./mission-list-screen.md) you are taken to the Mission Planning Screen. If user location is
available then the map gets zoomed into the user, otherwise you are zoomed into the previously planned mission.

There are 5 other options right below the menu button. They are (from top to bottom):

- `Single tap Geo-fence`
- `Add/Remove Vertices`

- `Save Drawing`
- `Proceed to Mission Parameters`

## Drawing Basics

All you have to do to create the drawing is ensure that the `Add/Remove Vertices` symbol is looking like a negative
sign. Then tap anywhere on the screen a black target looking icon will be displayed where you had tapped.
